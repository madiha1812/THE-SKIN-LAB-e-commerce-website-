 The Skin Lab — Skincare E-Commerce Website

The Skin Lab is a skincare e-commerce website created as part of my internship project. The main goal of this project is to design a unique, interactive, and user-friendly platform where users can explore skincare products based on their individual needs. Unlike a regular e-commerce website, The Skin Lab focuses on personalization by guiding users step by step to discover products suited to their skin type and skin concerns.

When a user visits the website, the first step is to select their skin type, such as oily, dry, normal, combination, or sensitive. After choosing a skin type, the website asks about the user’s skin concerns, for example acne, pigmentation, pores, or dryness. Based on these inputs, the site instantly recommends a set of skincare products tailored to the user’s profile. This makes the shopping process much more personal and engaging.

The website also includes a catalog of products with details like name, description, price, and ratings. Users can search for products, filter them by category, or browse recommendations. A shopping cart feature is built in, allowing users to add and remove products. The cart is interactive and uses local storage, so items remain saved even after the page is refreshed. The design is modern, minimal, and visually engaging, with smooth animations, gradient effects, and a responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile.

Since the project is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it does not rely on frameworks like React or Tailwind. This makes it lightweight, easy to run locally, and suitable for hosting on GitHub Pages or any other static hosting service. The code is written in a single index.html file but can also be separated into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files if needed.

The Skin Lab demonstrates how an e-commerce website can go beyond simple browsing by creating a more personalized and interactive shopping experience. In the future, this project can be expanded with additional features like user login, secure payments, and a backend system to manage products and orders. For now, it serves as a fully functional prototype that highlights the importance of combining design, interactivity, and usability in modern web development.<img
